    <p>This is a single paragraph, that is quite long so, hopefully, it can fill more of the page and give a good effect when looking at the final result. The text itself is not very creative, but as it is my very first HTML paragraph, I think nobody is actually mind it.</p>

    <p>Okay! This is the list I am talking about...</p>

    <ul> 
        <li>technologists</li>
        <li>thinkers</li>
        <li>builders</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And in order it would be </p>

    <ol> 
        <li>technologists</li>
        <li>thinkers</li>
        <li>builders</li>
    </ol>
